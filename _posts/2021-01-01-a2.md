Built a secure file sharing/redirection micro-service written in Python and deployed into Azure Kubernetes that returns one-time-use links as a 302 response for clients to follow and download direct from Azure blob container instead of a service that acts like a proxy which leads to faster upload/download times. The solution leveraged Azure Service Bus, Azure Blob Containers, Kubernetes, Managed Identities
