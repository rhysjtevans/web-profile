Designed and built a scalable (horizontal & vertical) observability service that consisted of single panes of glass and powered by ELK, Azure Monitoring/AWS CloudTrail Thanos.io, Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager.
This scraped and shipped logs centrally from many Kubernetes clusters in several regions.
Prometheus, Filebeat and Metricbeat were configured to dynamically discover services and scrape/ship logs & metrics to the centralised platform.
