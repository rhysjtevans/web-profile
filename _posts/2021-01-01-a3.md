By default Azure services typically provisions endpoints that are publicaly accessible including the Azure Kubernetes API endpoint.
For security, I migrated to Azure AKS environments that were built behind Azure Firewall's that routed both ingress and egress traffic through.
Ingress and Egress traffic was routed using [UDR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/egress-outboundtype){:target="_blank"} method and traffic was restricted at both Layer 4 and Layer 7 via Azure Firewall
